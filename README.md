wander - the Wasm Renderer

`wander` is a GPU-based rendering framework designed to be fully embeddable in any application.

Use `wander` to run `renderlets` in your existing software - self contained, portable modules of graphics data and code compiled to WebAssembly. 

## What can this do?

Renderlet is like Unity for Apps. Developers can build modern, interactive visualizations that run on any platform.

Many modern apps need a high-performance rendering engine that works in a browser or in a native app, where a JavaScript library won't scale, but a game engine is too heavy. 

### Example use-cases

Use `wander` to build things like:
* Modern CAD Apps: Use code to allow objects to describe how to render themselves
* Procedural Modeling and DataViz: Execute runtime code to view your data in new ways
* Product Visualization: Interact with dynamic objects in 3D on any device
* Composable User Interfaces: Render any UI module on top of an existing canvas or in any scene
* Interactive Animations: Like Adobe Flash, but with an actual programming language and GPUs
* Low/No-Code Graphics: Make a graphics pipelines out of existing building blocks

### Why use a renderlet?

The `wander` SDK brings all of the benefits of `renderlets` into your own application:
* High performance 2D and 3D graphics
* Fully portable rendering pipelines
    * Any app, device, client, or server
    * Sandboxed third party code execution
* Self contained rendering modules
    *  Reuse your graphics code as building blocks
* No game engine / platform dependencies
* No GPU expertise required

## Quickstart

`wander` is delivered as a cross-platform C++ library. Simply add wander.h/wander.cpp to your build chain along with the included dependencies such as `wasmtime`.

The basic API flow is:
```C++
const auto pal = wander::Factory::CreatePal(
        wander::EPalType::D3D11, baseDevice, baseDeviceContext);
auto runtime = wander::Factory::CreateRuntime(pal);

auto renderlet_id = runtime->LoadFromFile(L"Building.wasm", "run");

auto tree_id = runtime->Render(renderlet_id);
auto tree = runtime->GetRenderTree(tree_id);
```
1. Create a PAL object based on your device's underlying GPU API
2. Create a global `runtime` object. This is not currently thread safe
3. Load a `renderlet` file (with an optional entry point name) and get it ready to run
4. Run it! For static content this can be done once, but dynamic content could be per frame
5. Get a (non-owning) pointer to the output

Drawing the data is as simple as iterating the render tree:
```C++
// Set and global context necessary to render the data
deviceContext->PSSetShaderResources(0, 1, &textureViewWhite);

for (auto i = 0; i < tree->Length(); ++i)
{
    tree->NodeAt(i)->RenderFixedStride(runtime, stride);
}
```
There's no need to manage the underlying graphics data / buffers - `wander` takes care of it.

To delete/free old content, simple call:
```C++
runtime->DestroyRenderTree(tree_id);
```

Also, wander can tear down every object automatically on unload or close:
```C++
runtime->Release();
```

### Examples

Basic examples are provided in the [examples folder](examples/) for D3D11 and OpenGL.

The OpenGL build is not yet tested on Mac but should work with basic dependencies.

#### Building the examples

##### On Linux

First, build the build container. From the repository root:

```sh
podman build -t wander/buildimage -f ./Dockerfile
```

Then, use this container to build or rebuild the examples. To build the OpenGL example on Linux:

```sh
podman run --mount=type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/src,relabel=shared,U=true -w /src/examples/OpenGL wander/buildimage make buildlinux
```

This should produce a new `opengl` binary under `/src/examples/OpenGL`. Take a look at the `Makefile` for more info.

### :warning: Building renderlets

An example `renderlet` is provided in the examples - a 3D procedural model of a building - `building.wasm`.

We are currently working on a compiler and tool to make it easy to build your own renderlets.

If you want to experiment with building your own through raw wasm code, the wire format and signatures [can be found here](https://github.com/renderlet/wander/blob/e86d549606e24a04ae4b25544336b2744aec4ce0/wander.cpp#L331).

This format can and will change over time, so please only experiment with this if you are ok with breaking your renderlet on upgrade!

## Architecture / Roadmap 

Current (V1) architecture allows arbitray data to be generated on the CPU in Wasm which is automatically uploaded to the GPU via the `wander` SDK through the PAL.

The host app must know the "shape" of the data and bind a shader stage to the host graphics API to render the geometry / texture data to the Canvas.

Example - CAD, where arbitrary parts can generate geometry of a known format that the host app has the capability to shade

![v1 light](/docs/v1-light.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![v1 dark](/docs/v1-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

Future (V2) architecture allows arbitrary data to be fully rendered to an application's back buffer / canvas via an attachment to the graphics API exposed to Wasm.

V2 will enable fully arbitrary rendering of any data onto any Canvas. V2 has a dependency on the upcoming `wasi-gpu` spec.

Example - Full 3rd-party UGC/Content - Rendering arbitrary 2D gauges (like Flash) / 3D content (avatars) onto an existing Canvas layer in an app
